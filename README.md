# defrisher
API and script to manipulate images and compute the average color or the brightness of the latter

### Installation
 If you have `git` installed :
 
    $ git clone https://github.com/lukbrb/defrisher 
    
in the desired directory.
 
Otherwise you can downlaod the zip file.
 
 ### Requirements
 
To make sure that you have the required librairies installed (numpy, matplotlib, Pillow), you can run in your terminal:
 
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
 
All the librairies should now be installed.

### Run the script

You will first have to edit the script `fish_analyser.py` to add your own parameters, namely: the root directory where to look for the pictures, the average color the script should look for, or some filenames and image extension.

Once this is done, you can run:  

on Windows


    $ python fish_analyser.py  
    
    
on MacOS or Linux


    $ python3 fish_analyser.py
